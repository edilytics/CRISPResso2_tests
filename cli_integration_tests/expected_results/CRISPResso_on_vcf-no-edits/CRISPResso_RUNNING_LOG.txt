 Low number of total reads: <10000. Total reads: 100.
 <=1.0% of modifications were inside of the quantification window. Total modifications: 24, Modifications in window: 0, Modifications outside window: 24.
 >=1.0% of reads have modifications at the start or end. Total reads: 100, Irregular reads: 1.
 >=0.2% of substitutions were outside of the quantification window. Total substitutions: 24, Substitutions outside window: 24.
 >=30.0% of modifications were substitutions. This could potentially indicate poor sequencing quality. Total modifications: 24, Substitutions: 24.
