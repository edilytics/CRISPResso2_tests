 Low number of total reads: <10000. Total reads: 100.
 Disproportionate percentages of reads were aligned to amplicon: Reference, Percent of aligned reads aligned to this amplicon: 100.0%.
 Disproportionate percentages of reads were aligned to amplicon: Prime-edited, Percent of aligned reads aligned to this amplicon: 0.0%.
 >=1.0% of reads have modifications at the start or end. Total reads: 100, Irregular reads: 1.
 >=0.2% of substitutions were outside of the quantification window. Total substitutions: 37, Substitutions outside window: 36.
 >=30.0% of modifications were substitutions. This could potentially indicate poor sequencing quality. Total modifications: 40, Substitutions: 37.
