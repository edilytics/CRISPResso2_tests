 Low number of total reads: <10000. Total reads: 242.
 >=1.0% of reads have modifications at the start or end. Total reads: 235, Irregular reads: 235.
 >=0.2% of substitutions were outside of the quantification window. Total substitutions: 280, Substitutions outside window: 270.
 >=30.0% of modifications were substitutions. This could potentially indicate poor sequencing quality. Total modifications: 923, Substitutions: 280.
