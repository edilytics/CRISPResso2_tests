Removing Intermediate files...
 Low number of total reads: <10000. Total reads: 237.
 >=1.0% of reads have modifications at the start or end. Total reads: 236, Irregular reads: 178.
 >=0.2% of substitutions were outside of the quantification window. Total substitutions: 870, Substitutions outside window: 865.
 >=30.0% of modifications were substitutions. This could potentially indicate poor sequencing quality. Total modifications: 1460.0, Substitutions: 870.
